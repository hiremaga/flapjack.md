# FlapJack Plan

## Vision
Create a comprehensive markdown-based project management format that bridges the gap between traditional PM tools and developer-friendly workflows. FlapJack (Fluid, Layered Agile Planning for Just-right Agile Collaboration & Knowledge-tracking) should be maintainable by both humans and LLMs, fault-tolerant, and git-friendly.

## Stories

### Create minimal viable FlapJack format
@Claude @hiremaga #medium

As a project manager, I want a basic FlapJack format so that I can start tracking this project immediately.

- [x] PLAN.md uses FlapJack format
- [x] Basic story syntax works with metadata blocks
- [x] Simple iteration structure (Current + Backlog)
- [x] Support for both inline and detailed story formats
- [x] Wiki-links for cross-references

### Create formal specification document
#small

As a developer/LLM, I want a formal specification so that I can validate FlapJack format and build tools around it.

### Create project README
@Claude Code

Clear README explaining FlapJack purpose and quick start instructions.

### Create minimal working examples

As a new user, I want clear examples so that I can understand how to use FlapJack for my projects. #medium

### Ensure basic Obsidian compatibility

As an Obsidian user, I want FlapJack to work seamlessly with wiki-links and graph view. #small

- [x] PLAN.md renders well in Obsidian
- [x] Link navigation from iteration to story works
- [x] Checkbox can be checked from Obsidian directly
- [x] `#tag` searches work
- [x] Code syntax highlighting works in Obsidian
- [x] Code syntax highlighting works in Obsidian
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```

## Guidelines

### Sizing
- #xsmall: Quick task, few minutes, definitely under an hour
- #small: Straightforward feature, few hours
- #medium: Moderate complexity, upto a day
- #large: Complex feature, 2-3 days
- #xlarge: Large feature, ~1 week
- #xxlarge: Very large feature, multiple weeks

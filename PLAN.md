# FlapJack Plan

## Vision
Create a comprehensive markdown-based project management format that bridges the gap between traditional PM tools and developer-friendly workflows. FlapJack (Fluid, Layered Agile Planning for Just-right Agile Collaboration & Knowledge-tracking) should be maintainable by both humans and LLMs, fault-tolerant, and git-friendly.
